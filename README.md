Debug with [node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector) really
easily.

**You can use `node-debug2` now util @jfirebaugh merge my [pr](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/node-debug/pull/3).**

## Usage

```
$ npm install -g node-debug
$ node-debug path/to/your/script.js
```

Result: a Web Inspector debugger is open in your browser of choice, stopped
at the first line of the script.
